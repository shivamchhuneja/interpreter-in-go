# Interpreter in Go

This repository follows the book *[Writing an Interpreter in Go](https://interpreterbook.com)* by Thorsten Ball.

ðŸ“š **Why this repo exists**:
To get a deeper understanding of:
- How interpreters and programming languages work under the hood
- Lexers, parsers, ASTs, and evaluation

ðŸ§ª This is a learning project.

ðŸ“Œ Iâ€™ll be committing small pieces as I move chapter by chapter.  
Check the commit history to follow along.
